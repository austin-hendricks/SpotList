# SpotList - Personalized Spotify Playlist Creator

### Project Description:
"SpotList" is a mobile app development project that I undertook to enhance my skills in the realm of mobile application development. This project seamlessly integrates with Spotify's API and leverages the Spotify OAuth flow to connect to a user's account. The primary functionality allows users to effortlessly create a new playlist in their Spotify library, containing their top 25 tracks from the past 4 weeks.

### Key Features:

- Spotify Integration: The app establishes a secure connection with Spotify's API, utilizing the OAuth flow for user authentication. This ensures a seamless and authorized interaction with the user's Spotify account.

- Automated Playlist Creation: With a simple button click, users can generate a new playlist featuring their top 25 tracks from the last 4 weeks. This feature provides a sneak peek into their personal "Spotify Wrapped" and captures the essence of their favorite sounds during the season.

- TypeScript / React Native with Expo: The project is written in TypeScript and developed using React Native with Expo. This choice of technology ensures cross-platform compatibility and a smooth user experience on both iOS and Android devices.

- Native Libraries for Mobile Development: Several native libraries for mobile development were incorporated to enhance the app's performance and responsiveness, delivering a polished and native-like feel.


"SpotList" serves as a practical learning experience in mobile app development, showcasing my ability to integrate with third-party APIs, implement OAuth authentication, and create a user-friendly interface. The project not only demonstrates technical proficiency but also reflects my passion for creating applications that provide users with a personalized and enjoyable experience.
